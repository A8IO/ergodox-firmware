# rev-2 (`partial-rewrite`)

This branch is currently under development, and all parts are subject to
change.  I'll do my very best to keep the latest commit working properly
though.

*Pull requests will almost certainly not be accepted for this branch at this
time.*  
Sorry...  It's a bit hard to explain exactly why...  But perhaps it will be
understandable if I just say that I've been working on this project for quite a
long time now, and at this point rev-2 is kind of my baby.  Until it grows up,
and I send it out into the real world by moving it to the master branch, I feel
very protective of it.

Notes:
* Gyuri Horak implemented NKRO and mouse keys in [his branch]
  (https://github.com/dyuri/ergodox-firmware) of rev-2.  Not merged, but I plan
  to implement the features later, if I can.  See [Pull Request #28]
  (https://github.com/benblazak/ergodox-firmware/pull/28).
